# Apache Kafka benchmarks

For instructions on running the OpenMessaging bencmarks for Kafka, see the [official documentation](http://openmessaging.cloud/docs/benchmarks/kafka).

NOTE: This is a slightly modified version with two key differences:

- workloads have extra arguments for sending randomized payloads rather than the same payload over and over.
- there is a new argument that converts all output result json files into a single csv.

TODO: Document these changes.
