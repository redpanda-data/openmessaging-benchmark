# Redpanda Benchmarks

## Requirements

- Terraform

- Ansible and modules:
    - geerlingguy.node_exporter
    - prometheus.prometheus
    - grafana.grafana

- Python 3 set as default.

- The [terraform inventory plugin](https://github.com/adammck/terraform-inventory)

- aws-cli

## Setup

1. In the top level directory run `mvn clean package`. This will build the benchmark client needed during deployment.

2. Create an ssh key for the benchmark using the following: `ssh-keygen -f ~/.ssh/redpanda_aws`. Set the password to blank.

3. In the `driver-redpanda/deploy` directory.  Run the following: 
```
	cp terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars
        terraform init
        aws sts get-caller-identity || aws sso login
        terraform apply -auto-approve
```

4. To setup the deployed nodes. Run:

```
        if [ "$(uname)" = "Darwin" ]; then export OBJC_DISABLE_INITIALIZE_FORK_SAFETY=YES; fi
        if [ "$(uname)" = "Darwin" ]; then brew install gnu-tar; fi # https://github.com/prometheus-community/ansible/issues/186
        ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yaml
        ansible-playbook deploy.yaml
```

## Running the benchmark

1. SSH to the client machine. 

        ssh -i ~/.ssh/redpanda_aws ubuntu@$(terraform output --raw client_ssh_host)

2. Change into the benchmark directory 

        cd /opt/benchmark

3. Run a benchmark using a specific driver and workload, for example: 

        sudo bin/benchmark -d driver-redpanda/redpanda-ack-all-group-linger-10ms.yaml \
            driver-redpanda/deploy/workloads/1-topic-100-partitions-1kb-4-producers-500k-rate.yaml

## Generating charts

Once you have ran a benchmark, a json file will be generated in the data directory. You can use `bin/generate_charts.py` to generate a a visual representation of this data.

First install the python script's prerequisites (Note Python 3.10 or later is not currently supported):

```bash
python3 -m pip install numpy jinja2 pygal
```

The script has a few flags to say where the benchmark output file is, where the output will be stored, etc. Run the script with the help flag for more details (from the project's root directory):

```bash
./bin/generate_charts.py -h
```

You will need to create an output folder (named `output` here):

```bash
mkdir output
```

Then run the script. The following example looks for benchmark files in `bin/data` and sends output to the folder created above:

```bash
./bin/generate_charts.py --results ./bin/data --output ./output
```

The output of this command is web page with charts for throughput, publish latency, end-to-end latency, publish rate, and consume rate (open in your favorite browser).

## Cleanup

Once you are done. Tear down the cluster with the following command: 

	terraform destroy -auto-approve
